Welcome, Welcome Welcome!

I am a senior engineer of sorts with over ten years of experience in the world of Information Technology. I have dabbled in many different fields of work, including but not limited to networking, systems administration, and desktop administration. 

Currently I am a Site Realiability Engineer utilizing cloud technologies, CI/CD pipelines, Information as Code and Scripting. I specialize in Amazon Web Services where I hold a AWS SysOps Administration certification. 

Aside from all the technical jargon above I am also an avid reader across various genres with a particular soft spot for Sci-Fi and Supernatural, a gamer who has explored countless worlds across multiple platforms over the decades and taking on the challenge achievement of fatherhood to two teenage daughters.
