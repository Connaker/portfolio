Welcome, Welcome Welcome!

With over a decade of experience in Information Technology, I have worked across a broad spectrum of disciplines, including networking, systems administration, desktop support, and cloud management. Currently, I specialize in Site Reliability Engineering, where I focus on optimizing operations through cloud technologies, CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code, and automation scripting. I am particularly passionate about Amazon Web Services, holding both AWS SysOps Administrator and AWS Developer certifications.

Outside the technical realm, I’m an avid reader with a passion for Sci-Fi and Supernatural genres, and a dedicated gamer, having explored countless virtual worlds across multiple platforms. Yet, my most fulfilling adventure is fatherhood to my two teenage daughters and a newborn son — a role that brings immense joy and fresh challenges every day.
