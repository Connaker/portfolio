Welcome, Welcome Welcome!

As a seasoned engineer with over a decade of experience in Information Technology, I've had the opportunity to explore a diverse range of fields, including networking, systems administration, desktop support, and cloud management. My current focus is on Site Reliability Engineering, where I leverage cloud technologies, CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code, and scripting to ensure smooth and reliable operations. I'm particularly passionate about Amazon Web Services, where I hold an AWS SysOps Administrator certification.

Beyond the technical landscape, I'm an avid reader with a love for Sci-Fi and Supernatural genres, and a dedicated gamer who has journeyed through countless worlds across various platforms. My most rewarding adventure, however, is fatherhood to two teenage daughters, a role that brings both joy and new challenges every day.
